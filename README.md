## Things to think

- Instead of user_id I should display username. Though, it may be renamed
- When user renames sticker pack, code is broken, I should find ways to fix it
- There has to be a lot more of async operations in code, lots of operations
  might be done in background. Will make them if I would need more python
  experience
- There has to be another, more mature way to store data â€” to refresh and cache
  a lot of info in the database
- Think about Telegram API limitations
